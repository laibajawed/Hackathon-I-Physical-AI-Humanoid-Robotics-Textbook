# Chapter 6: Simulation Environments

## Overview

This chapter covers the design and implementation of realistic simulation environments that accurately represent real-world conditions for robotics testing and development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Design realistic simulation environments
- Implement sensor models in simulation
- Validate simulation fidelity
- Transition from simulation to reality (Sim-to-Real)

## Environment Design Principles

Creating effective simulation environments requires attention to:
- Physics accuracy
- Sensor modeling
- Environmental complexity
- Computational efficiency

## Practical Exercise

Design and implement a complex simulation environment with multiple robots and obstacles.

## Summary

This chapter covered the principles of simulation environment design. Module 2 is now complete, and we'll move on to advanced robotics with NVIDIA Isaac in the next module.
