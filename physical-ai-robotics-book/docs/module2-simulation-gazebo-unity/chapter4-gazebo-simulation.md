# Chapter 4: Gazebo Simulation

## Overview

This chapter introduces Gazebo, a powerful 3D simulation environment for robotics. Gazebo provides realistic physics simulation, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Set up Gazebo for robotic simulation
- Create and configure simulation environments
- Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2
- Implement physics-based robot models

## Gazebo Features

Gazebo provides several key features for robotics simulation:
- Realistic physics engine
- High-quality rendering
- Sensor simulation
- Plugin architecture
- Robot model support

## Practical Exercise

Create a simple robot model and simulate it in Gazebo with ROS 2 integration.

## Summary

This chapter covered the basics of Gazebo simulation. The next chapter will explore Unity-based simulation.
