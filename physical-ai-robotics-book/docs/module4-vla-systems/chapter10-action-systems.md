# Chapter 10: Action Systems

## Overview

This chapter focuses on action planning and execution systems that translate high-level goals and commands into low-level robot actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement action planning algorithms
- Create action execution frameworks
- Integrate perception and action systems
- Handle action failures and recovery

## Action System Components

Effective action systems include:
- Task planning
- Motion planning
- Execution monitoring
- Failure recovery
- Human-in-the-loop systems

## Practical Exercise

Implement an action system that executes complex tasks based on natural language commands.

## Summary

This chapter covered action systems in robotics. Module 4 is now complete, concluding the core content of the textbook.
