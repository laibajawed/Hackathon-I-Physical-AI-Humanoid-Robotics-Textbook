# Chapter 9: Vision-Language Integration

## Overview

This chapter explores the integration of vision and language processing in robotics, enabling robots to understand and respond to natural language commands based on visual input.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement vision-language models for robotics
- Process natural language commands with visual context
- Integrate multimodal AI models
- Create intuitive human-robot interfaces

## Vision-Language Models

Modern vision-language models enable:
- Object recognition with natural language descriptions
- Visual question answering
- Command interpretation
- Scene understanding

## Practical Exercise

Implement a vision-language system that responds to natural language commands based on camera input.

## Summary

This chapter covered vision-language integration in robotics. The next chapter will explore action systems.
