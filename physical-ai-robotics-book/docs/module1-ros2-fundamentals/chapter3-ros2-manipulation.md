# Chapter 3: ROS 2 Manipulation

## Overview

This chapter focuses on robotic manipulation using ROS 2, covering the MoveIt 2 framework and other tools for controlling robotic arms and grippers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Set up MoveIt 2 for a robotic arm
- Plan and execute manipulation trajectories
- Control end-effectors and grippers
- Implement grasp planning algorithms

## MoveIt 2 Framework

MoveIt 2 is the core framework for manipulation in ROS 2, providing:
- Motion planning
- Inverse kinematics
- 3D collision detection
- Kinematic and dynamic simulation

## Practical Exercise

Implement a pick-and-place task using MoveIt 2 with a simulated robotic arm.

## Summary

This chapter provided an introduction to robotic manipulation in ROS 2. Module 1 is now complete, and we'll move on to simulation techniques in the next module.
