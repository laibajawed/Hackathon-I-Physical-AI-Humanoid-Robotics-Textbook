# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Basics

## Overview

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster to support the communication between ROS nodes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2
- Set up a basic ROS 2 environment
- Create and run simple ROS 2 nodes
- Understand the ROS 2 architecture

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to provide better support for real-world applications, including improved security, real-time capabilities, and multi-robot systems.

## Key Concepts

### Nodes
Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 system. Each node runs a specific task and communicates with other nodes through messages.

### Topics and Messages
Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Messages are the data structures that carry information between nodes.

### Services
Services provide a request/response communication pattern, allowing nodes to request specific actions from other nodes.

## Practical Exercise

Create your first ROS 2 package and node following the steps in the official ROS 2 tutorials.

## Summary

This chapter provided an introduction to ROS 2 and its core concepts. The next chapter will dive deeper into navigation concepts.
