# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Navigation

## Overview

This chapter covers the navigation stack in ROS 2, which provides the tools and algorithms necessary to move a robot from one location to another safely and efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the ROS 2 navigation stack
- Configure navigation parameters
- Implement path planning algorithms
- Execute navigation tasks on a simulated robot

## Navigation Stack Components

The ROS 2 Navigation stack includes several key components:
- Costmap 2D
- Navigation Core
- Controller Server
- Planner Server
- Recovery Server

## Practical Exercise

Implement a navigation task using the Navigation 2 stack with a TurtleBot3 simulation.

## Summary

This chapter covered the navigation capabilities in ROS 2. The next chapter will explore manipulation concepts.
